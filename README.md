Give your experiences a classic Roblox vibe by restoring the ability to apply and convert surfaces to studs and more on your parts, models, meshes and unions.
</div>

## Installation

Resurface is an open source plugin, available via the Roblox Creator Store, Itch.io and [source code via GitHub][github-page].

### Creator Store

The Creator Store is the easiest way to install Resurface, with access to automatic updates and the ability to use Resurface anywhere you have Roblox Studio installed.

### Itch

If you would like to leave an optional donation to show your support, you can also purchase Resurface via Itch\.io.

[![Get on Itch][button-itch]][itch-page]

There's currently no way to automatically install and update plugins obtained via third-party storefronts. You'll need to manually download and drop the plugin file into your Studio plugins directory for each update. You will also need to repeat this process for every device you wish to use the plugin on.

### Open Source

If you'd like to inspect or clone Resurface's source code, it's available over on its official GitHub page.
